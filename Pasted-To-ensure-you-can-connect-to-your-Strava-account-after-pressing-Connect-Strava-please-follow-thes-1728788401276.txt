To ensure you can connect to your Strava account after pressing "Connect Strava", please follow these steps:

Verify Strava Authentication Route: Make sure the /strava_auth route is correctly setting up and redirecting to the Strava OAuth authorization URL. You have this route set up in routes.py.

Check Redirect URI: Ensure that the REDIRECT_URI specified in strava_utils.py is correctly configured and registered in your Strava app settings. It should match what you have set in your Strava API credentials.

Handle Callback Logic: Ensure the /strava_callback endpoint is implemented and accessible so that Strava can redirect back to it with the authorization code once the user authorizes the app. This function should look like the one you have in routes.py.

Exchange Authorization Code for Token: In your /strava_callback function, ensure that the authorization code provided by Strava is being correctly exchanged for an access token using the exchange_code_for_token() function from strava_utils.py.

Check for Errors: Implement error handling so that if the token exchange fails or any step in the process encounters an issue, you can debug it easily. Make sure you are handling cases where the token_data might be None.

Debugging: Check the console or network logs in your web browser for any HTTP errors or misconfigurations during the OAuth flow.

Here's an example on how the successful callback should be handled in your Flask app:

@app.route('/strava_callback')
@login_required
def strava_callback():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    token_data = exchange_code_for_token(code)
    
    if token_data:
        current_user.strava_access_token = token_data['access_token']
        current_user.strava_refresh_token = token_data['refresh_token']
        current_user.strava_token_expiry = datetime.fromtimestamp(token_data['expires_at'])
        db.session.commit()
        
        fetch_and_process_activities()
        flash('Strava account connected successfully!', 'success')
    else:
        flash('Failed to connect Strava account.', 'error')
    
    return redirect(url_for('calendar'))
Please ensure that everything related to OAuth setup and redirections follows the guidelines for OAuth authentication. Also, cross-verify the app credentials used (client ID and secret) are correct in strava_utils.py.
